        <p>In 1974, C. Reed Knight Jr. established and developed a leading enterprise in the field of enhancing user
            lethality; Knight’s Armament Company.<br /> His mission was to produce exceptional and innovative products
            while
            maintaining an unwavering commitment to value, quality, and client<br /> services.<br />
            <br />
            After initial cooperative work with mentor and friend Eugene Stoner, he has personally driven innovation
            that has directly enhanced the<br /> professional users of small arms. His vision led to the development of
            the
            original rail-interface system which has become standard world-wide.<br />
            <br />
            The SR-25 proved that a semi automatic rifle can be both sufficiently precise and reliable for combat sniper
            application and was adopted as the<br /> M110 in 2007. Knights Armament also developed one of the most
            versatile
            and iconic suppressors, the NT4, which has been in service prior to the<br /> Global War on Terror and
            continues
            to serve today.<br />
            <br />
            Reed also raised the bar on AR15 pattern rifles with the SR-15/16 family of carbines, known for low recoil
            and legendary endurance.<br />
            <br />
            Knight Vision continued the innovation by producing inline night vision systems that established the
            industry standard, both in image<br /> intensification and thermal detection lines. Several of these optics
            are
            ongoing programs of record, with even more advanced products in<br /> constant development. Committed to
            evolving
            the capabilities of today’s warfighter, Knight’s remains at the forward edge of the industry and our<br />
            Nation’s battles.<br />

        <p>Knight’s Armament Company (KAC) is a veteran-owned sole proprietorship small business that produces firearms,
            suppressors, accessories,
            and night vision devices.<br />
            <br />
            The majority of R&D and production efforts are executed within the boundaries of the KAC facility in order
            to provide the best
            possible control of product quality and information continuity.<br />
            <br />
            Among its 300(+) employees, KAC boasts an experienced engineering staff, well equipped for research into all
            aspects of
            small arms and advanced electro-optic technology.<br />
            <br />
            The KAC facility features numerous test cells, ranges, and explosive storage areas. Five live-fire ranges
            for small arms, from short<br />
            function testing ranges to the 1,000 meter range, are used in the development and product qualification of
            numerous small arms systems.<br />
            <br />
            Both indoor and outdoor ranges facilitate testing during rare cases of inclement weather.<br />
            <br />
            KAC also maintains an anechoic test cell used in the study of acoustic signatures of firearms.
