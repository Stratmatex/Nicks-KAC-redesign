            <h1>The M110 SASS: For When Success <br>
                is Measured by the Millimeter. </h1>
            <p>The M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS) and its SR-25 based variants are current program <br>
                of record 7.62mm NATO sniper and sniper support rifles across the US Armed Forces and with <br>
                our international allies. First fielded experimentally in the early 1990s as the SR-25, and quickly <br>
                refined into the Mk 11 Mod 0 for adoption with SOF units, these systems were combat proven <br>
                to be highly effective and efficient. <br>
                <br>
                Current M110s are available in multiple barrel lengths, with multiple signature reduction <br>
                device integration options, and with several options for improved user-interface. <br>
                <br>
                Every M110 offered has been designed and refined for a specific requirement not otherwise <br>
                available on the market, evaluated and validated to be suitable for the <br>
                conditions of modern combat.

            <h1>M110K2/3</h1>
            <p>The M110K2 is a 7.62mm NATO carbine of comparable weight and size to some 5.56mm platforms.<br>
                The lightweight 16” hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel is optimized for<br>
                weight reduction and durability with minimized need for dedicated maintenance.<br>
                While oriented to “heavy carbine” applications, it will support mid-range precision tasks with<br>
                appropriate ammunition. <br>
                <br>
                The M110K3 is a purpose-built dual-role carbine; equally adept at putting rounds on target past 800<br>
                meters
                or multiple moving targets at close range, with a weight and form-factor that is easy to carry and<br>
                employ.
                Barrel and bolt life are extended beyond expectation, and in conjunction with the E2 gas system,<br>
                significantly improves suppressed and unsuppressed functionality in adverse conditions.<br>

        <p>The M110K5 is a the truest form of a 7.62mm Combat Carbine/Heavy Carbine. The precision 14.5 inch hammer
            forged
            chrome-lined hybrid profile barrel affords reduced <br>
            overall length while supporting both mid-range precision tasks as well as close-range multiple shot
            engagements.
            As the system was born from the need for <br>
            the shortest possible practical configuration, a DSR suppressor is generally integrated, as it further
            reduces
            weight and length in comparison to a QDC suppressor, <br>
            but one of the QDC muzzle devices can also be used to expand the available suppressor options. <br>
            <br>
            Along with the usual kit tailoring, the URX4 handguard is available in either 15” or 13.5” lengths depending
            on
            the needs of the user; the 15” URX4 will partially cover the DSR device, <br>
            while the 13.5” URX4 will permit a broad selection of task-optimized devices, including the DSR. Available
            in
            tailored packages with user-requested furniture, optics, and other support <br>
            items, as well as upgrade options to existing in-service SR 25/M110 systems.

            <p>The M110A2 is purpose-built to provide precision fire on point targets past 1,000 meters. <br>
                The 20” ordnance grade steel barrel is 5R cut-rifled, with a precision-oriented chamber <br>
                and a tapered heavy profile to offer optimal thermal characteristics both with and <br>

                <br>
                The URX4 handguard is available in either 15” or 17.7” lengths depending on the accessory <br>
                and enabler requirements of the user, and is sufficiently rigid to seamlessly integrate bipods <br>
                or clamp into suitable tripod systems. <br>
                <br>
                The standard QDC three-prong flash hider reduces flash significantly while also permitting the <br>
                attachment of any KAC QDC Signature Reduction Device, or a DSR suppressor can be attached <br>
                directly to the muzzle threads for reduced overall length when suppressed. <br>
